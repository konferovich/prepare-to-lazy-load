# prepare-to-lazy-load

PHP function adds the "<b>lazy</b>" class to all found IMG tags.

If the <b>IMG</b> tag has the "<b>skip-lazy</b>" <b>attribute</b>, then no class is added to that tag and no replacement occurs.

You can use <b>yall.js</b> to check. Just paste it into the head of the page.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/yall.js"></script>
```

You can get more information about yall.js in this repository: <b> https://github.com/malchata/yall.js/ </b>
